# PCA-Image-Reconstruction
A short notebook outlining image reconstruction using PCA.

If GitHub does not render the notebook, please use this [nbviewer's](https://github.com/g-nitin/PCA-Image-Reconstruction) link for the notebook.
Jupyter runs a free, public instance of nbviewer at https://nbviewer.org, so we use it to render Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub.
