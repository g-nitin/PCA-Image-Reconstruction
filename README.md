# PCA-Image-Reconstruction
A short notebook outlining image reconstruction using PCA.

If GitHub does not render the notebook, please use this [nbviewer's](https://nbviewer.org/github/g-nitin/PCA-Image-Reconstruction/tree/main/) link for the notebook.
Jupyter runs a free, public instance of nbviewer, so we use it to render Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub.
